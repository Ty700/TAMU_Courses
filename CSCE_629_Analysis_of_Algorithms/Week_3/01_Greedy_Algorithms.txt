Greedy Algorithms 
    Algorithms for optimization problems will go through a sequence of steps, with a set of choices at each step. 

    For many optimization problems, using dynamic programming is overkill

    A simpler, more efficent algorithm will do... introducing greedy algorithms

    That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice leads to a globally optimal solution
