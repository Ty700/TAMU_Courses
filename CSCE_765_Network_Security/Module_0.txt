Computer and Network Security
    Why is it important?
        Our computers are quite vulnerable
            - Poor design or after the fact design
            - Lack of awareness and education 
            - Weak threat model and under-estimation of attacker capabilities 
            - Buggy software

Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Attacks
    - A threat to a system is any potential occurrence, malicious or otherwise, that can have an adverse effect on the assets and resources associated with the system.
    - A vulnerability of a system is some characteristic that makes it possible for a threat to occur 
    - An attack on a sstem is some action that involves exploitation of some vulnerability in order to cause an existing threat to occur 

Types of Threats 
    Can be classified into four broad categories 
        - Disclosure - unauthorized access to information 
        - Deception - acceptance of false data 
        - Disruption - interruption or prevention of correct operation 
        - Usurpation - unauthorized control of some part of a system 
    
    Examples:
        Snooping
        Sniffing
        Spoofing
        Delaying
        Denial of Service 
        Malware
        Theft of Computational Resources 

Primary Issues 
    Confidentiality
        - prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information
    
    Integrity
        - prevention of unauthorized modification of information

    Availablitity
        - Ability to withstand unauthorized withholding of information or resources 
    
Network Attacks 
    Passive Attacks
        
        1. Release of Message Contents
            Scenario:
                Bob sends Alice a message over a network, or internet
                Darth can read Bob's message to Alice

            Consequence:
                Essentially, it reveals what Bob is saying to Alice 

            Fun Note:
                An MIT Technology Report in 79' used "Alice" and "Bob." Thus, it became a tradition.
        
        2. Traffic Analysis 
            Scenario:
                Bob sens Alice a message over a network, or internet
                Darth can observe the pattern of messages from Bob to Alice

            Consequence:
                Essentially, it ONLY reveals the fact that Bob is talking to Alice 

        Final Notes on Passive Attacks
            - Passive attacks are VERY difficult to detect as there aren't any noticable consequences as it's passive in nature...
            - To avoid these, focus on prevention
