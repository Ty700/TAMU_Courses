# Objectives
During week 4, we will talk about the content of Chapter 3, instruction-level parallelism, learning about dynamic branch prediction, tournament predictors, and branch target buffer.

## At the end of this module, you will be expected to:
- Explain and demonstrate how a correlating branch predictor works by mapping.
- Draw a (2,3) predictor with 4 entries per table and calculate the space requirement for the predictor (# bits).
- Show the prediction for each branch instruction using a tournament predictor with four entries.
- Show the final contents of Predictor 1 buffer and Predictor 2 buffer.
- Compare performance for a processor with the branch-target buffer versus a processor that has a fixed 2-cycle branch penalty.
