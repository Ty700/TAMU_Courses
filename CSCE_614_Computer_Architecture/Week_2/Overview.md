# Week 2 Overview

During Week 2, we will explore ISA further, as well as performance, power, and reliability.

## Objectives
At the end of this module, you will be expected to:
- Show the contents of registers and memory after executing the assembly code.
- Calculate and compare speedup using enhancements.
- Express the relationship between Power and Energy with a mathematical equation.
- Calculate MTTF of a disk subsystem with varying components.
- Calculate MIPS rate for various branch alternatives.
- Label the diagram of the datapath and control signals given instructions.
- Calculate the timeline of execution for code on a pipelined datapath considering dependencies.
