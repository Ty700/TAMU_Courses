Power/Energy, Cost, and Reliability

Power and Energy 
    Problem:
        Get power in, get power out
    
    Thermal Design Power (TDP)
        - Characterizes sustained power consumption 
        - Used as target for power supply and cooling system 
        - Lower than peak power (1.5x higher), higher than average power consumption 
    
    Clock rate can be reduced dynamically to limit power consumption 

    Reducing power consumption is important...  however energy per task is often a better measurement 
        - Big difference 

Dynamic Energy and Power vs Static Energy and Power 

    Dynamic Energy 
        - Switching power 
            - Transistor switching from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0
            - 1/2 * Capacitive load * voltage^2
    
    Dynamic Power 
        - 1/2 * Capacitive load * voltage^2 * Frequency switched = C*V^3
    
    Reducing clock rate reduces power, not energy 

    Example of Quantifying Power
        Suppose 15% reduction in voltage results in a 15% reduction in frequency. 
        What is impact of dynamic power?

        Power(dyn) = 1/2 * CapacitiveLoad * voltage^2 * frequency_switched

                    = 1/2 * 0.85 * CapacitiveLoad * (0.85xVoltage)^2 * frequency_switched
                    = (0.85)^3 * Oldpower(dynamic)
                    = 0.6 * Oldpower

Power Trend 
    Intel 80386
        - 1985
        - 2W

    Intel Skylake 
        - 2017
        - 130W

    Heat must be dissipated from the chip which can be expensive do to the limit of what can be cooled by air

Reducinng Power
    Techniques for reducing power 
        - Do nothing well... which is lower efficiency
        - Dynamic Voltage-Frequency Scaling 
        - Low power state for DRAM, disks 
        - Overclocking one core and turning off other cores

Static Power 
    Static power consumption 
        - 25 to 50% total power 
        - Current(static) * Voltage
        - Scales with number of Transistors
        - To reduce: 
            Power gating -> Turning machine off
            - Same amount of power will be consumed even if there are no tasks running 

Trends in Cost 
    Cost driven down by learning curve 
        - Yield 
    
    DRAM
        -Price closely tracks cost 

    Microprocessors
        - Price depends on volume 
        - 10% less for each doubling of volume

Dependability 
    Module reliability 
        - Mean time to failure (MTTF)
            - How often failures happen
            - Reciprical of MTTF is rate of failure 
        - Mean time to repair (MTTR)
            - How long it takes to recover from failure
        - Mean time between failures (MTBF) = MTTF + MTTR 
            - Uptime between failures
        - Availability = MTTF / MTBF
            - Percentage I believe
