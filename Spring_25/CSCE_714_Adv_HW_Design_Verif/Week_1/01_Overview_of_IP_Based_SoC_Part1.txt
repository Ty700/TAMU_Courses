System on Chip (SoC)   
    - An integrated circuit that incorporates all components of an electronic system, including processors, memory, and interfaces, onto a single chip 

Within a SoC you have:
    A Subsystem 
        - A major functional block within an SoC that performs a specific high-level function, composed of multiple IP blocks working together

Example:
    Smartphone Processor 
        - CPU 
        - GPU
        - memory
        - Display 
        - Inputs (volume up/down, power, etc)

        A Subsystem can be the graphics rendering subsystem that includes the dedicated GPU, memory and its controllers 
            - the subsystem is the functional block inside the SoC that focuses on a specific function 
        

Intellectual Property 
    - A reusable unit of logic, cell, or chip layout design that is the intellectual property of one party, often licesen for use in complex chip
        designs. IP blocks and can be used in different subsystems and SoC designs.
    
    Common IPs
        - Processor cores (CPU, GPU)
        - Memory Controllers 
        - Standard Interfaces (AMBA, USB, PCIe, SATA, Ethernet)
        - Wireless communication modules (Wifi, Bluetooth, 5G)
        - Security modules
        - Analog/Mixed-signal blocks 

IP Integration in SoC Design 
    You have different providers that provide different IPs 

    Say ARM supplied the CPU, Sympsys providedd the memory controller 

    Every IP is supposed to be preverified.
        - proven to work within those providers 
        - don't need expertise in each areas, when developing a product
    
    1. System Architecture Defintion 
        - Define SoC requirements and high-level block diagram 
        - Identify IP blocks and their integration 

    2. IP selection and acquistion 
        - Choose and license appropriate IPs
        - Consider performance, power, area, and cost 
    
    3. Interface Standardization 
        - Adopt industry-standard interfaces (e.g., AMBA)
        - Ensure compatibilty between IP blocks

AMBA Overview 
    - Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA)
        - AHB, AHI, etc 
    
    APB3 -> Advanced Periphral Bus Version 3
        - Fits in system level and block level of the SoC 
        - Part of the interconnecting architecture
        - Used for low speed devices 
        - Used to connect and allow different IPs to talk to each other

Evolution to IP-Based SoC Design 
    Early SoC Development 
        - Characterized by full-custom, monolithic designs 
        - In-house development of all components 
        - Limited reusability across projects 
        - Increased complexity and longer time-to-market for advance chips

    IP-based Design (early 2000s - mid 2010s)
        - Introduction of pre-designed, pre-verified IP blocks 
        - ARM's CPU IP (e.g., Cortex cores) revolutionized SoC Designs 
        - Shift from in-house development to IP integration 
        - Emergence of specialized IP vendors 

    Modern IP-centeric SoC Design (Mid 2010s - Present)
        - Wide availabilty of complex, domain-specific IPs 
        - Standardization of interfaces (e.g., AMBA protocols)
        - Ecosystem of IP marketplaces and platforms 
        - Significant reduction in time-to-market and development costs 
        - Motivated by "One company can't do it all"
            - One company will specicalize in AI applications, another will do graphics, another will do security 

            Example:
                - Apple M1's chips uses a lot of different IPs 
                    - M1 uses a lot of Standardization interfaces from different companies 
                    - All of them together combine to provide a new standard of chip

Verification IP: (VIP)
    - Prepackaged set of code that is used for verification 
    - A set of assertions that we can use to verify the design 
        - To verify a bus protocol for example 
    - As IPs became popular, VIPs became popular 
    - Contains stimulus sequence that will check a specific block in the IP 

    APB Peripheral VIP:
        - Model simple peripheral devices on the APB bus 
        For example, we might be interested in the read and write transfers 
            - Ensuring proper setup and timing 
            - These VIPs will have the registers that will check the states of read and write registers and make sure they hold their values 
    
    On the verification test bench, you will have:
        Requester VIP Agent 
    
        and a 

        Completer Agent
