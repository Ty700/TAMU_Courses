Connectivity and Interfaces 
    - Predesigned, reusable modules for I/O operations and communication protocols 
    - Interface between main processing units and external components 

        Key Functions:
            - Data transfer and communication (UART, SPI, I2C, USB)
            - Sensor interfaces and control 
            - External memory interfaces 
        
    Verification Challenges
        Protocol Compliance 
            - How are we validating all the protocol states and their transitions 
            - specifications 
            - handshake mechanisms

        Data Integrity 
            - Verifying data transfers across different speeds/bauds don't change data 
        
        Interoperability 
            - Verifying the compatibilty with different protocol versions
                - ABP2 -> APB3 
    
    IP Interconnection 
        - different IP blocks might use different communication protocols or interfaces, leading to integration challenges 
            - Example:
                AXI to AHB
                APB to AHB 
            
        - Extra bridges are required 
            - APB to AHB bridge 
            - AXI to AHB bridge 

        - A bridge is a hardware component that enables communication between different communication protocols
            - A "translator" 

System Integration Verification
    - Pre-verified IP blocks still require verification of their interconnections 
    - Focus on testing interactions between integrated components 
    - Verification of system-level functionality 
    - How do these IPs work together to perform a system level tasks 
    - How do you deal with shared resources when things are tied together?
    - Timing relationships 
    - Cross IP functionality

Protocol Compliance
    - IP blocks communicate through standardization protocols 
    - Verification must ensure correct protocol implementation across all implementations
    - Test timing, data integrity, and handshaking between blocks 
        - AXI, APB, PCIe must be verified and are correct at all places 

Bus Functional Models (BFMs)
    - Simulate protocol behavior for comprehensive testing 
        - Master/Slave operation to verify both sides of communication
        - Protocol monitoring to ensure compliance 
        - Translation of high-level transactions (read/write) into bus-level signals 
            - How to translate a write/read on memory operation onto a bus level signal 
            - BFMs translate high level operations into detailed bus level signals 

Advantages of IP-Based SoCs 
    Reduce Development Time 
        - Faster Time-to-Market
            - Reuse pre-verified IP and accelerate design process 
        - Shortened Design Cycle 
            - Designers can integrate existing IPs insteda of developing components from scratch 
    
    Improved Reliabilty and Quality 
        - Pre-verified IPs are relatialbe, and has proven performance 
    
    Modularity 
        - Reusable 
    
    Less verification work 
        - pre-verified IPs are already known working
    
    Reduced Risk 
        - Data lowers the risk of functional issues during validation 
    
    Reusability across projects
