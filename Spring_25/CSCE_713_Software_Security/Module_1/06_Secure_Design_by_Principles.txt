Possiblity to Eliminate ALl vulnerabilties
    - Is it true? 
        - Nearly impossible to eradicate all vulnerabilties, but also to ascertain they have been completely addressed 
        - Big company have bug bounty programs that pay users to find bugs and report them 
        - Pen testing is also another way to search for vulnerabilties
            - Pen testing involves simulating cyberattacks to identify and fix security vulnerabilties
    
    - In this class we talk about pen testing 
        - Red vs Blue 
            Red 
                - Red Team, often a 3rd party entity 
                - Focuses on attacking the system without prior knowledge of the src code 
                - Objective is to uncover seurity weaknesses by simulating potential attacks 
            
            Blue  
                - Blue team is tasked with defense 
                - Working to fix the vulnerabilties discovered by the red team and strengthening the system's security measures. 
    
    - In addition to these methods, there are ways to build a system with secuirty in mind 

Build a Secure System by Principle 
    Security Principles 
        - Security "Best Practice" that can help us build a consequentially more secure system 
        - Can't guarantee an invulnerable system, but has better chance minimizing the emergence and impact of vulnerabilties
        - Grounded in methodologies for system design, and are intended to resutl in a more robust and secure system. 

8 Security Priniciples
    - Economy of mechanism 
        - simplicity of design 
    - Fail-safe default 
        - access that should be granted based on explict permission rather than exclusion 
    - Complete mediation 
        - requires every access to be checked for authority without exception 
    - Open design 
        - encourages public scrutiny of the system's design instead of keeping it confidential, ensuring the design is robust against threats 
    - Separation of Privileges 
        - System does not rely on one condition to grant access 
    - Least privileges 
        - limits users to the minimal level of access necessary for their task 
    - Least common mechanism
        - minimizing shared elements across multiple user functionality
    - Psychological accetabilty 
        - security measures should not hinder access to resources more than if security were absent  
        - importance of designing security systems that users can and will use effectively
