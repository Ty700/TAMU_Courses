Other Security Priniciples in Practice
    - Security by Obscurity
        - Hiding the technical details of your implementation 
        - Increasing the difficulty of reverse engineering 
            - Orogram ibfuscation 
            - Noises added into code or binary 
        
        - Contrats security by open design 
        - hiding details to make it more difficult for attackers to compromise a system 
        - increasingly common as a means of security 
        - One technique is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) 
            - randomizies memory address spaces, making it harder for attackers to predict and exploit memory locations 

    - Security by Deception 
        - The use of honeypots 
        - Set a trap for attackers by creating a network with decoy machines that appear to be legitimate users 
        - when attacker direct their efforts at the machines, their behavior can be monitored and analyzed 
        - helps developers understand how an attacker would attack their system and then can defend against it 

    - Security by Depth 
        - layer your system with multiple barriers of defenses 
        - each barrier will increase the difficulty for the attacker to intrude the system, eventually mounting to enormous efforts that render the attack unprofitable 
        - slows down the attack in real-time, thus allowing an attack to be spotted easier
