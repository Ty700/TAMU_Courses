Common vulnerabilties and Exposure (CVE) database 
    - Records known past vulnerabilties 
    - Every known vulnerabilty has a:
        ID - A unique ID assigned by NVD 
        Severity - Common Vulnerabilty Scoring System (CVSS)
            - Ratings:
                - Low:      0.0 ~ 3.9
                - Medium:   4.0 ~ 6.9
                - High:     7.0 - 10.0
            
            - Associated Vectors
                - Access Vector (AV), Access Complexity (AC), Authentication (Au)
                - Confidential Impact (C), Integrity Impact (I), Availablitiy Impact (A)
                - Exploatiability (E), Remedation Level (RL), Report COnfident (RC)
                - Collateral Damage potential (CDP), Target Distribution (TD), Security Requirements (CR, IR, AR)
            
            - Weakness Enumeration
            - Known affected software configuration 

    - If you discover and report bugs in a project, you might recieve a CDP record, which is a notable feat 
    - CVSS score is determined by evaluators who review the reported vulnerabilties and assign a score based on their judgement 
        - process is somewhat subjective
    - In addition to severity, CVE includes Associated vectors that provide further details about the vulnerabilty. They indicate wheter the vulnerabilty can be exploided locally, or remotely, 
        the complexity of the attack required, whetehr authentication is needed, and the types of impacts it has on Confidentiality, integrity, and availability
    
    Common Weakness Enumeration
        - The concept of internal weakness denomination refers to the categorization of vulnerabilties, fo rwhich there is a standard called Common Weakness Enumeration
        - Comprehensive list that documents different types of vulnerabilties that can be referenced for classification purposes.
