Confidentiality
    - Giving people access to information that they shouldn't access 
    - Valuable information:
        - Profitable to the attackers
            - Credit card info 
            - Encryption keys 
            - Digital properties 
                - Music, movies, copyright 
        
        - Private Information:
            - Not directly profitable, but valuable to personnel
            - Examples:
                - Medical Records
                - Locations
                - Travel pins
                - Browsing and search history
            - All this private information can hurt you personally
                - Might be held by blackmailing
                    - "I have your medical records, give me money or I'll expose you"
                - Location:
                    - If a theif knows you aren't home, then they know when to come and steal your things 
            
            - Definition:
                - Can be defined with communication channels
                    - How much information can be retrieved by the user?
                
                - Secure System -> User 
                    - Encryption can be used to restrict access only to the user and system 
                    - Introduce noise to the channel
                    - Censoring and redacting 
                        - Parsing over entire data and removing critical data 
                    - Elimate the channel 
                        - IE Miltary computers 
                            - "Air gapped Computers"
                                - Computers that are entirely disconnected from the outside 
                
            - Confidentiality vs Privacy
                - Confidentiality   
                    - Protection of the DATA or SYSTEM STATES from illegal observation 
                - Privacy
                    - Protection of the users' indentities or personal states from illegal observation 
                        of data or metadata 
                    
                    Example:
                        Alice is communicating to Bob over confidential channel 
                            - Alice might expose she is communicating with bob exposing metadata
                                - Metadata:
                                    - Who is sending the message
                                    - How big is the message
                                    - When is the message sent 
            
            Confidentiality Violation Examples 
                - Keylogger
                    - A mechanism that records all the keystrokes on a keyboard and logs it somewhere
                    - Attacker can find sensitive information 
                        - a password could be entered after a banking URL or some sort of email addres 
                
                - Mobile App Permissions 
                    - Permissions that can violate Confidentiality if allowed
