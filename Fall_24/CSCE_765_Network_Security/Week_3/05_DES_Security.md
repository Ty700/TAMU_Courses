### DES Security Concerns

- **Initial Arguments for Security**:
    - In a previous lecture, it was noted that DES seemed secure due to the **avalanche effect**:
        - Changing **1.5%** of the plaintext could result in a **45%** change in the ciphertext.
    - However, **DES** is vulnerable due to its **56-bit key** length, making it susceptible to **brute-force attacks**.

### Overview of DES Vulnerabilities

1. **Key Size**:
    - **56-bit keys** are considered too short.
    - **Brute-force attacks** are feasible with modern technology.
    - In **1998**, a **distributed attack** cracked DES in just **3 minutes**.
    - By **1997 estimates**:
        - A **$1,000,000 machine** could crack DES in **35 minutes**.
        - A **$10,000 machine** could crack DES in **2.5 days**.
        - Today, a **laptop** could brute-force DES.

2. **Other Concerns**:
    - The **S-Box** design is not well understood.
    - DES has survived some **sophisticated attacks**, like **differential cryptanalysis**, but it's still vulnerable.

### How to Improve DES?

#### **Idea 1: Super-Encryption (Double DES)**

- If key length is a concern, encrypting the plaintext **twice** can be considered:
  
  ```plaintext
  C = E(K2)(E(K1)(P))   // Double encryption
  P = D(K1)(D(K2)(C))   // Double decryption
