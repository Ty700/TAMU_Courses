# Overview

- The main goal of this module is to introduce students to the basic concepts of cryptography, mainly focusing on private key encryption and the DES cipher.

## Students will be able to:

- Understand the role of cryptography in protecting network communications through block ciphers such as DES and other variants.

## Objectives:

- Define public key and private key cryptographic models.
- Identify the strengths and weaknesses of encryption algorithms, especially the DES cipher.

## Learning Activities:

To complete this module:
- View all Module 1 presentations.
- Complete Module 1 Practice Quizzes.
