Reconnaissance 
    - "casing the hoint" 
    Let's take a close look at:
        - Reconnaissance with whois (this lecture)
        - Reconnaissance with DNS (next lecture)

        - A few words about a registrar:
            - Organization where you register a domain name 
            - verifies uniqueness of name 
            - Enters domain name into various databases:
                - Whois and DNS 

Whois Databases 
    - Input: Domain name or comapny name 
    - Output: registrar, whois server, dns server 

    Some useful whois sites:    
        - www.internic.net 
            - For com, net and org top-level domains 
        - www.allwhois.ord 
            - For country0code top level domains, EX: .jp, .fr 

Recpmmaossamce: IP Ranges 
    - ARIN: American Registry for Internet Numbers 
        - Maintains whois databse that includes IP address for US 
    
    - RIPE: Europe 
    - APNIC: Asia

Why whois databses needs to be publicly available 
    - If you're under attack, can analyze source address of packets
    - Can use whois database to obtain info about the domain from where teh attack is coming from 
    - Can inform admin that their systems are source of an attack
