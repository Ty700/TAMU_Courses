Review of DNS 
    - Distributed Database implemented in hierarchy of many DNS servers 

Authoritative name server:
    - FOr a given domain provides server name to IP address mappings for servers in domain 
    - Primary and secondary name server for reliability 
    - Responsible for mapping of IP addresses and names on a network

DNS: Queries 
    Host in UAB.edu wants to connect to a server in UMass.edu
    - The name cs.umass.edu needs to broken-down into a IP address for UAB.edu host to connect to it 
    - UAB Host will query the local DNS server 
    - Local DNS server will not have it since the name is not in its database 
    - Local DNS server will forward it to the root DNS server 
    - Root DNS server will tell it to forward its query to the Top-Level-Domain DNS Server 
    - TLD DNS Server will then tell the local DNS server where to forward its query 
    - Local DNS Server will query the right DNS Server and that DNS Server will forward the IP to the local DNS server 
    - Local DNS server iwll connect host to the IP 

DNS Records 
    DNS: Distributed DB storing resource records (RR)
        RR Format: (Name, Value, Type, TTL) -> Name = HOST (if its a host), Value = IP Address of HOST, TTL = Time to Live (Experiation Date for Resource record)
            Type: Can be address, a name server, or mailserver 

            Type=A -> Address 
                - Name is hostname 
                - Value is IP Address 
            
            Type=NS 
                - Name = Domain 
                - Value = IP Address of Authoritative name server for this domain 
            
            Type=MX 
                - Value is name of mailserver associated with name 

DNS Protocol:
    Sent over UDP Port 53 

Caching And Updating Records 
    - Once (any) DNS server learns mapping, it caches mapping 
        - Cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time 
        - Improves efficiency of lookips of name/address mapping 
            - Hwoever, what if attacker poisons the DNS cache by forward any google.com query to the attacker's machine 

    Interrogating DNS Servers 
        - Attacker first gets primary or secondary authoritative server for target organization using whois 
        - Attacjer cab tgeb qyery tge DBS vy sebdubg DBS query messages 
        - Tools (often available in Unix and Windows machines; also available at websites):
            - nslookup 
                - Can fetch all the RR this server is storing 
                - Avaliable in most Unix and Windows machines 
                - Get yahoo DNS server anme using whois 
                - set type=any 
                - "get all"
            - host 
            - dig 

Summary 
    - Obtaining information from public databases:
        - whois database 
            - Tool: Web sites 
        - DNS Database 
            - Tool: nslookup 
    
    - Defense:
        - Keep to a minimum what you put in the public database: Only what is neccessary
