Network Mapping
    Goal: Learn about a remote network 
    - Learn about the path each packet will take 
        - Where firewalls, and other security measures are

    - Attacker often uses traceroute to determine path to each host discovered during ping sweep 
        - Overlay results from traceroute to create an approximate network diagram 

Traceroute  
    - CLI command 
        - traceroute <src> <dest>

    How it works:
        - Src sends UDP packets to target 
            - Each to an unlikely port 
            - 3 Packets with the same TTL, then increments TTL 
        
        - When router decrements TTL to 0, sends back to source ICMP packet 
            - Type 11, Code 0, TTL Experied 
        
        - When target recieves packet, sends back to src ICMP packet 
            - type 3, code 0, destination port unreachable
