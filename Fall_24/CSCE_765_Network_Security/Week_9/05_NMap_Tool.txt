NMap 
    - Extremely Popular 
        - Usually run over linux 
        - Rich feature set 
        - Need root to use all features 
    
    - Ping Sweeping 
        - Over any range of IP addresses 
        - With ICMP, SYN, ACK 
        - OS Determination 
    
    - Port Scanning 
        - Over any range of ports 
        - Almost any type of TCP, UDP Packet 
    
    - Source IP Address spoofing 

Usage:
    
    Input:
        - nmap [Scan Type] [Options] <target_host>
            - Default for port scanning: Ports 1-1024 + Ports listed in nmap service file 

    Output:
        - Open ports: SYN/ACK returned; port is opened 
        - Unfilited (closed) ports: RST returned: Port is closed but not blocked by firewall 
        - Filtered ports: Nothing returned; port is blocked by firewall 

Ping Sweep Example
    CMD:    
        Nmap -sP -v 116.27.38/24 
            - Sends ICMP echo request (ping) to 256 addresses 
            - Can change options so hat pings with SYNs, ACKS, ...
            - -sP = ping 
            - -v = verbose

Polite Port Scan
    CMD:
        Nmap -sT -v target.com 
            - Attempts to complete a 3-way handshake with each target port 
            - Sends SYN, waits for SYNACK, sends ACK, then sends FIN to close connection 
            - If target port is closed, no SYNACK returned 
                - Instead RST packet is typically returned 
            - TCP connect scans are easy to detect 
                - Target (eg. Web Server) may log completed connections 
                - Gives away attacker's IP Address

TCP SYN Port Scan 
    CMD: 
        Nmap -sS -v target.com 
            - Stealthier than polite scan 
            - Send SYN, receive SYNACK, sends RST 
            - Stealthier: Hosts do not record connection 
                - Since the connection is never established (handshake not completed)
                - but routers with loggin enabled will record the SYN packet 
            - Faster: Don't need to send FIN packet 

TCP ACK Scans 
    CMD:    
        Nmap -PA -v target 
            - Many filters (in firewalls and routers) only let internal systems host initiate TCP connections 
                - Drop packets for whcih ACK=0: No sessions initiated externally 
            - To learn what ports are open through firewall, try an ACK scan (segments with ACK=1)

            - Why does this work?
                - Firewall is not expecting an ACK packet, thus allows it through. 

UDP Port Scans 
    CMD:
        nmap -PU target 
        - UDP doesn't have SYN, ACK, RST packets 
        - nmap simply sends UDP packet to target port
            - Nothing comes back -> Port Open 
            - Port unreachable -> Port Closed 

Obscure Source 
    CMD:
        namp -n -D IP1, IP2, ...
        - Attacker can enter list of decoy soruce IP addresses into NMap 
        - For each packet it sends, Nmap also sends packets from decoy soruce IP addresses 
            - For 4 decoy srcs, sends 5 packets 
    
        - Attacker's actual address must appear in at least one packet, to get a result 
        - If there are 30 decoys, victim netwrok will have to investigate 31 different sources 

TCP Stack Fingerprinting
    CMD:
        namp -O target 
        - In addition to determining open ports, attacker wants to know OS on targeted machine:
            - Exploit machine's known vulnerabilities 
            - hacker can set up lab environments similar to target network 
        - TCP implementations in different OSes respond differently to illegal combinations of TCP flag bits 

Warnings using NMap 
    - Use carefully 
        - Do not scan entire network 
        - Scanning a host for testing/learning purposes is fine 
        - Please keep in mind the ethics of security education 
            - Lab will be the safes platform to try
