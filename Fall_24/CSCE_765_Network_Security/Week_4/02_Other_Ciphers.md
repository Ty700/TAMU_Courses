# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- **National Institute of Science and Technology**
  - DES is an aging standard that no longer addresses today's need for strong encryption
  - Triple DES: Endorsed by NIST as today's defacto standard

- **AES: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**
  - Finalized in 2001
  - **Goal**:
    - To define Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) by selecting a new powerful encryption algorithm suitable for encrypting government documents
  - AES candidate algorithms were required to be:
    - Symmetric-key, supporting 128, 192, and 256 bit keys
    - Royalty-Free
    - Unclassified (i.e., Public Domain)
    - Available for worldwide export

## AES Round-3 Finalist Algorithms:
- **MARS**
  - Candidate offering from IBM

- **RC6**
  - Developed by Ron Rivest of RSA Labs, creator of the widely used RC4 algorithm

- **Twofish**
  - From Counterpane Internet Security

- **Serpent**
  - Designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen

- **Rijndael: The winner!**
  - Designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen

## Other Symmetric Ciphers and their applications:
- IDEA
- Blowfish - hashing passwords and password files
- RC4, RC5
- SAFER (used in Bluetooth)
