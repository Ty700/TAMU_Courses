Message Authentication Codes 
    - Provide integeriy as well as authentication
    - Send (m, MAC); MAC is created on m using the key shared between two parties 
        - Requires sender to attack a MAC to the message and send it with the message
        - The reciever will verify if the MAC is the right MAC
    - Has to be deterministic to enable verification 
        - Unlike encryption schemes 
        - Everytime you create a MAC on the same message, it will create the same MAC value
        - Works with a key, message, and then create a MAC that way 
        - Reciever will use the same key and determine if the MAC is correct 
    - We want MAC to be as small and as secure as possible 
        - Fixed size 
    - Can not provide non-repudiation
        - Why not?
            - Since MACs are made by shared-keys, we don't know who made the MAC. 
            - Unlike digital signatures 

MAC - Functions 
    - KeyGen
        - outputs a key 
    - MAC 
        - Creates a checksum on m using key K 
    - Verify 
        - Validates whether the checksum on m is computed correctly 
        - Just create MAC and compare 

Security Notion for MAC 
    - Very similar to the secuirty notion for a digital signature scheme 
    - Existential forgery under adaptively choosen mmessage attack 

MAC Based on Block Cipher in the CBC mode 
    - CBC-MAC 

    ** INSERT PHOTO @ 7:20 ** 

    Encryption could be AES or Triple-DES

CBC-MAC 
    - IV = [0]
        - Unlike CBC Encryption

    - Only the last block of the output is used as a MAC 
    - This is secure under CMA Attack 

HMAC: MAC using hash functions 
    - Key based hash but almost as fast as non-key based hash functions 
    - AVoids export restrictions unlike DES based MAC 
    - Provable security
    - Can be used wiht idfferent hash functions like SHA-1, MD5, etc
