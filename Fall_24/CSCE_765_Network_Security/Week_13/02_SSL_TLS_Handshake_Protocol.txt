Establishing Secure Sommunications 
    First, establish TCP connection from client to port 443 on server 

    1. Client Hello 
        - Client sends ClientHello message proposing SSL options
            Includes:
                - SSL Version 
                - RandomNumber 
                    - 32-byte random number used to seed the cryptographic calculations 
                - SessionID 
                    - identififes a specific SSL session 
                - CipherSuites 
                    - a list of cryptographic parameters tha tthe client supports 
                - CompressionMethods
                    - Identifies data compression methods the client supports 
    2. Server Hello 
        - Server responds wiht ServerHello message selecting the SSL options 
            - Picks Version
            - RandomNumber
            - SessionID 
            - CipherSuite that the client and server will use 
            - CompressionMethods that the client and server will use

    3. Server Key Exchange 
        - Server sends its public key information in ServerKeyExchange message 
            - Server send its public key certificate 

    4. ServerHelloDone 
        - Server concludes its part of the negotiation with ServerHelloDone message 

    5. ClientKeyExchange 
        - Client sends session key information (encrypted with server's public key) in ClientKeyExchange message 
            - Generates a premaster secret 
            - sends it encrypted with the server's public key 
            - Server decrypts the premaster secret using the private key 

            
    6. ChangeCipherSpec 
        - Client sends ChangeCipherSpec message to activate the negotiated options for all future messages it will send 

    7. Finshed 
        - Client sends finished message to let the server check the newly activated options. 
    
    8. ChangeCipherSpec 
        - Server sends ChangeCipherSpec message to activate teh negotiated options for all future messages it will send 

    9. finished
        - Server sends Finished message to let the client check the newly activated options
