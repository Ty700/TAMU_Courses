SSL: Secure Sockets Layer 
    - Widely deployed security protocol 
        - Supported by almost all browsers and web servers 
        - https 
        - Tens of billions $ spent per year over SSL 
    
    - Originally designed by Netscape in 1993 
    - Number of Variations:
        - TLS: Transport layer security, RFC 2246 
    
    - Provide:
        - Confidentiality 
        - Integrity 
        - Authentication 
    
    - Original goals:
        - Had web e-commerce transations in mind 
        - Encryption 
        - Web-server authentication 
        - Optional client authentication 
        - Minimum hassle in doing business with new merchant 

    - Available to all TCP applications 
        - Not just web 
        - Email, IMAP, SMTP, FTP, etc 
        
Which Layer to Ad Security to?
    - PGP 
        - Application Data security 
        - Any app data will be encrypted, authenticated, etc 
        - All of ti will be done in the application itself
            - Email client itself 

    - Transport Level Security 
        - SSL/TLS 
        - HTTP will be sent to the SSL layer 
        - SSL layer will add security to it 
        - Then it will be passed to the TCP layer 
        - TCP will then throw it to IP layer, etc, etc 
        - Any layer that works with HTTP will work with SSL/TLS protocol 
    
SSL and TLS Brief History 
    - SSL 2.0 was developed and patented by Netscape in 1994 
    - TLS is the non-proprietary Interenet standard development (RFC 2246, 1999)
    - TLS 1.0 was an upgrade of SSL 3.0
        - so TLS 1.0 is sometimes referred to as SSL 3.1 
    - Latest standard is TLS 1.3, sometimes referred to as SSL 3.4

SSL Main COmponents 
    1. Handshake 
        1. Negotiation of protocol algorithms, versions and parameters 
        2. Authentication of communicating parties 
        3. Agreement of session keys 
    
    2. Secure Session Communication
