DNS Attacks 
    - Reflection attacks 
        - Leverage DNS for attacks on arbitrary targets 
    - Denying DNS service 
        - Stop DNS root servers 
        - Stop TLD servers 
        - Stop local server

    Two attacks discussed:
        - Use fake DNS replies to redirect user 
        - Poisoning DNS:    
            - Insert false resource records into various DNS caches 
            - False records contain IP addresses operated by attackers

DNS Attack: Redirection 
    1. Client sends DNS query to its local DNS server; sniffed by attacker 
    2. Attacker responds with bogus DNS reply 

    Issues:
        - Must spoof IP address: set to local DNS server 
        - Must match reply ID with request ID 
        - May need to stop reply from the local DNS server 

Posisoining DNS Caches 
    - Poisoning: Attempt to put bogus records into DNS name server caches 
        - Bogus records could point to attacker nodes 
        - Attacker nodes could phish 
    
    - But unsolicited replies are not accepted at a name server 
        - Name servers use IDs in DNS messages to match replies to queries 
        - So can't just insert a record into a name server by sending a DNS reply message 

    - But can send a reply to a request 

    Goal: Put bogus IP address for tamu.edu in local TAMU DNS Server 
        1. Attacker queries local DNS server 
        2. Local DNS makes iterative queries 
        3. Attacker wiats for some time; sends a bogus reply, spoofing authoritative server for tamu.edu
