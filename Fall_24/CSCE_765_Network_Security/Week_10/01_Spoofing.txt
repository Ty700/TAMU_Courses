IP Address Spoofing 
    - Attacker doesn't want actions traced back 
    - Simply re-configure IP address in Windows or Unix 
    - Or enter spoofed address in an application 

    Simple:
        Change local host's IP address to some other IP 
        Send packet 
    
    - Attacker cannot interact with victim 
        - When attacker communicates with victim, victim will send packets to spoofed IP 
        - Thus it's only a one-sided conversation 
        - Unless attacker is on the path of the spoofed IP 
    
IP Soofing with TCP?
    - Can an attacker make a TCP connnection to server with spoofed IP address?
    - Not easy: SYNACK and any subsequent packets are sent to spoofed address 
    - If attacker can guess initial sequence number, can attempt to send commands 
        - Send ACK with spoofed IP and correct seq #
    - But TCP uses random inital seq numbers 

Defense: ngress and Egress filtering
    - Egress filtering
        - firewall which will analyze all source packet IP addresses that are leaving the network 

    - Ingress Filtering 
        - Firewall whcih will analyze all source packet IP addresses that are entering the network 

    - Ingress is more effective 

Ingress Filtering: Upstream ISP 
    - Collab between ISPs 
    
Ingress Filtering Summary   
    - Effectiveness depends on widespread deployment at ISPs 
    - Deployment in upstream ISPs helps, but does not eliminate IP spoofing 
        - Filtering can impact router forwarding performance 
    - Even if universally deployed at access, hacker can still spoof another addres in its access network
