Interconnection Devices 
    - Hubs 
    - Switches 
    - Routers 

Hubs 
    - essentially phtiscal-layer repeater
        - bits coming from one ling go out all other link 
        - at the same rate 
        - no frame buffering 
        - no CSMA/CD at hub: adapters detect collisions
        - provides net management functionality 
        - "Dummy Router"    
            Example:
                Alice is sending a message to Bob.
                Alice sends message to a hub that Bob is connected to.
                Hub will send Alice's message to all the connections it has.
                The host machines getting Alice's message will only accept it if it is expecting Alice's message 
        - Leaves vulnerability for sniffing if attacker is in the network 

Sniffing 
    - Attacker is inside firewall 
    - Requirements:
        - Attacker's host connected to shared medium 
        - NIC shold be in "promiscuous mode" 
            - Processes all frames that comes to NIC 
    
    - Sniffer has two components 
        - Capture
        - Packet analysis 
    
    - Grab and File Away:
        - Userids and passwords 
        - Credit card numbers 
        - Secret e-mail conversations 

    - Island Hopping Attack:
        - Take over single machine
        - Install sniffer, observe passwords, take over more machines, install sniffers 

Passive Sniffing 
    - Easy to sniff
        - 802.11 traffic 
        - Ethernet traffix passing through a hub 
            - Any packets sent to hub is broadcast to all interfaces 
            - Not true for a switch 

    - Popular sniffers 
        - wireshark
        - tcpdump (for unix)
        - Snort (sniffing and instrusion detection)
    
Active Sniffing through a switch: Flooding Switch Memory Approach
    - How does attacker sniff packets sent to/from the victim?
    - Have to get victim's packets to attacker 
    - Has a table that tracks port with the corresponding MAC address 
    - If attacker knows the MAC address to a certain port 
        - The attacker will send many requests to the switch telling it that it has XYZ MAC on ABC port 
        - This will flood the switch's memory, thus ovewritting the MAC/PORT tbl the switch has 
        - Thus any packet that has the victim's MAC and port on it, will then be forwarded to attacker's computer instead 

Sniffing through LAN: Poison Victim's ARP Table Approach
    Idea: Have client's traffic diverted to attacker 

    Step 0:
        Sniff all frames that arrive. Configure so that IP packets arriving from victim are forwarded to defaul router 

    Step 1: 
        Send fake ARP response, mapping router IP address to attacker's MAC address 

    Step 2:
        Victim sends trafficc destined to outside wordl. 
        Poisoned ARP table causes traffic to be sent to attacker 
    
    Step 3:
        Packets are forwarded from attacker's host to default router 
    
    Summary:
        Victim sending out packets thinks they are sending it to the router. 
        However, it is sending it to the attacker, attacker sends it to the router 
        router sends it to the outside world 

        Note:
            This can be reversed. 
            Attacker poisons the router saying the victim's IP is the attacker's IP. 
            Any incoming packets go to the attacker, then attacker sends it to the victim 

    Powerful active sniffing tools 
        - DSniff and ettercap 
            - Flooding switch memory
            - ARP posionig 

Sniffing Defenses 
    - Encrypt Data: IPsec, SSL, PGP, SSH 
    - Use encryption for wireless 
    - Get rid of hubs: Complete migration to switched network 
    - Configure swtiches with MAC addresses 
        - Turn off self learning (knowing mappings between ports and MAC addresses)
        - Eliminates flooding problem 
    - Intrusion detection systems:
        - Lookout for large numbers of ARP replies 
    - Honeypot 
        - Create fake account and send password over network 
        - Identify attacker when it uses the password
