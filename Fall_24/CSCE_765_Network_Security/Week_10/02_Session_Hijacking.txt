Session Hijacking 
    - Take control of one side of a TCP connection 
    - Marriage of sniffing and spoofing  
    - A form of Man-in-the-Middle attack 

    - Alice sends message to Bob
        - Alice (unknowingly) actually sends message to Attacker 
    - Attacker forwards message to Bob under the impression they're Alice 
    - Bob sends message back 
    - Attacker sends Bob's message back to Alice (under the impression they're Bob)

    - Attacker can do a lot with this. 


The Details 
    - Attacker is on segment where traffic passes from Alice to Bob 
        - Attacker sniffs packets 
        - Sees TCP packets between Bob and Alice and their sequence numbers 

    - Attacker jumps in, sending TCP packets to Bob; source IP address = Alice's IP addresses 
        - Bob now obeys commands sent by attacker, thinking they were sent by Alice 

    - Principal Defense: Encyption + MAC 
        - Attacker does not have keys to encypt/authenticate and insert meaninful traffic
