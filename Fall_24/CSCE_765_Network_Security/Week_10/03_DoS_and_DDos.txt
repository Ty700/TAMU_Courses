Denial-of-Service Attack 
    - Prevent access by legitimate users or stop cirtical system processes 
    - Implementation
        - Vulnerability Attack:
            - send a few crafted messages to target app that has vulnerability
            - Malicious messages called the "exploit"
            - Remotely stopping or crashing services 
        
        - Connection Flooding Attack:
            - Overwhelming queue with SYN flood 

        - Bandwidth Flooding Attack
            - Overwhelming communications link with packets 
            - Strength in flooding attack lies in volume rather than content 

DoS and DDoS 
    - Dos 
        - source of attack small # of nodes
        - source IP typically spoofed 

    - DDos 
        - From thousands of nodes 
        - IP addresses often not spoofed 
        - Use of bots 

DoS: Examples of Vulnerability Attacks 

    Land: 
        - sends spoofed packet with source and dest address/port as the same 
        - Local Area Network Denial 
        - Spoofed SYN packet with source and destination both being the victim 
        - On receipt, victim's machine keep on responding to itself in a  loop 
            - Causes the victim to crash 
            - Many old OSes were vulnerable 

    Ping of Death 
        - Sends oversized ping packet
        - ICMP Echo Request (Ping) is 56 bytes 
        - If a ping message is more than 65,536 bytes, this can cause some machines to crash 
        - Older windows systems 

    Jolt2 
        - Sends a stream of fragments, none of which have offset of 0. Rebuilding consumes all processor capacity 
        - TCP/IP fragments contain Offest field to:
            - Overlappig values 
                - Bad/old implementation of TCP/IP stack crashes when attempting to re-assemble the fragments 
            - Or very large values 
                - Target system crashes 

    Teardrop, Newtear, Bonk, Syndrop
        - Tools send overllaping segments, that is, fragment offsets incorrect
