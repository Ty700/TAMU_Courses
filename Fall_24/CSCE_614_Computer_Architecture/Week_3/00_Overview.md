## Week 3 Objectives

During Week 3, we will focus on topics from **Appendix C**, exploring the **5 steps of datapath** for the RISC-V pipeline, as well as examining **data, structural, and control hazards** in depth.

You will learn how to:
- Implement a CPU and design the datapath step by step.
- Use the speedup equation to optimize performance.
- Reduce the number of stalls.
- Use **forwarding** to avoid data hazards.
- Apply **scheduling** techniques to avoid load hazards.

### By the end of this module, you will be expected to:
- **Use the speedup equation** to compare:
  - Speedup vs unpipelined systems.
  - Speedup vs systems with stalls.
  
- **Compare the performance** of two different state diagrams in **two-level branch prediction**.
