## Course Description
- Review of Von Neumann architecture and its limitations
- Parallel computer structures
- Concurrent Computation
- Pipeline computers
- Vectorization methods
- Array processors
- Multiprocessor architecture and programming
- Dataflow computers

## Course Focus
Understanding the design techniques, machine structures, technology factors, and evaluation methods that will determine the form of computers in the 21st century.

### Computer architecture is at a crossroads:
- Institutionalization and renaissance
- Power, dependability, multi-CPU, GPU, accelerator

### Mix of lecture vs discussion

### Goal is to learn how to do good system research:
- Learn a lot from looking at good work in the past
