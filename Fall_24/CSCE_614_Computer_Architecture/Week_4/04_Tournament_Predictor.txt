Tournament Predictors 
    - Multilevel branch predictor 
    - Use n-bit saturating counter to choose between predictors 
    - Usual choice between global and local predictors 

    BHT 
        - Local address 
        - Based on history, predict the future branches 
        - Used for loops

    Correlating 
        - Used to determine if a branch is correlated to another 
        - Nested if statements 

    - Each different type of branch you can choose different type of branch predictors 

    Tournament predictor using, say, 4k 2-bit counters indexed by local branch address.
    Choose between:
        Global Predictor
            - 4k entries index by history of last 12 branches 
            - Each entry is a standard 2-bit predictor
        
        Local Predictor 
            - Local history table: 1024 10-bit entries recording last 10 branches, index by branch address 
            - The pattern of the last 10 occurrences of that particular branch used to index table of 1k entries with 3-bit saturating co
